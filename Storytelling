##1. The Beginning of My Journey
Since I was able to hold a crayon, I knew I wanted to pursue education in the field of art. Over time, I realized the significant value graphic design holds for me, and it's a field in which I want to continually educate myself because it fulfills what I promise to achieve in my life's mission. Graphic design is a weapon against chaos, helping us organize the vast amount of information that bombards us daily, making it a necessity both now and in the future.

##2. Graphic High School
I spent a long time preparing for an art high school, and when I thought the drill was finally over, it had just begun. High school taught me discipline, precision, and allowed me to express myself through my art. Here, I learned various graphic techniques, including historical methods such as relief printing, intaglio, screen printing, and lithography. Unfortunately, at that time, I did not realize the great value they would represent for me. I particularly enjoyed linocut and its imperfections. Another favorite technique of mine was screen printing, which, although not as old, is widely used today in textile printing, especially for high-quality products but is only cost-effective for large quantities. In my opinion, every technique has its magic; it's only as effective as your matrix, and the right technique must be chosen based on the print volume. Nowadays, we have digital printers that can produce a large quantity in record time, with matrices provided electronically. But isn't there something special about holding a matrix in your hands, on which an artist has spent hours, knowing that after printing the maximum quantity, it won't be reusable, making each print somewhat original?

##3. College of Creative Communication
At the College of Creative Communication, I gained skills in project management, creating marketing strategies, text campaigns, and graphic processing. I was enriched with perspectives from all sides, significantly complexifying my thinking. It expanded my knowledge, but I also realized that I want to focus more on the visual aspect exclusively and not spread my energy across all possible disciplines.

##4. Internship
Entering a modern printing press was a big shock for me. Here, I realized that something was missing for me in the artistic industry, and I wanted to focus more on the visual aspects that bring me joy. My internship supervisors taught me the most from all life phases. They showed me which types of designs sell, why, and how to create them. I also spent a lot of time in the production of promotional items, textile printing, finishing works, especially cutting the required graphics to a specific format. I learned about the job market in this field, where I also want to be involved in the future, and they taught me how to work with these types of customers. They also imparted a lot of experience in the field of printing, which I didn't realize interested me until I graduated from high school. It's crucial in this industry to pay attention to detail, deadlines, and above all, the quality of execution. It's necessary to balance quality and quantity because although many customers want everything immediately, they would rather wait and pay extra for aesthetically pleasing results in high resolution and on good material, rather than have the work done only halfway, mainly for the sake of having something.

##5. Journey Towards Detailed Execution
Even though I felt like a fish in water in the graphic industry, I longed for better detailed execution of visual and technological processing. That's why I continue at Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem to focus more on the historical development of graphic and printing techniques. Graphics and printing have a closely related history, where the development of printing techniques influenced how graphics were created and reproduced. And it's precisely this field that I want to dedicate myself to for the rest of my life, further refining and expanding my knowledge under the guidance of competent teachers.
